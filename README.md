# Menace Amiga Format
 The 1988 Amiga game 'Menace' that was published in Amiga Format in 1990, this repo contains source code and changes that were made for the YouTube video series about it. The plan is to upgrade this source to assemble and work for a more modern Amiga (source was written during the A1000/500 era of the Amiga)
