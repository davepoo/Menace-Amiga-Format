THE CONTENTS OF DAVEJONES

Everything in DaveJones locker (drawer) goes with the feature on games
programming in the March issue (number 8) of Amiga Format.

This month Psygnosis programmer Dave Jones gives the low down on how
to produce convincing horizontal scrolling.

You can double click on the MENACE SCROLL file to see the first level 
of Menace scroll smoothly by.

All the Assembler scource and graphic data is present inside the drawer. 
These files can only be accessed from the CLI.

The files in the drawer DAVEJONES include:

foregrounds
map
panel
menace scroll.s
menace scroll
menace scroll.info
menace scroll.doc
menace scroll.doc.info


HiSoft's Devpac or another like assembler can be used to examine and modify
the source code.
