[33mDAVE JONES' LOCKER[0m

Everything in Dave Jones' Locker (drawer) goes with the feature on games
programming in the June issue (number 11) of Amiga Format.

This month Psygnosis programmer Dave Jones puts together smooth scrolling
with alien movement. 

You can double click on the MENACE program icon to see the result of
combining the scroll with the ship animation and alien flight paths. Click
the left mouse button to quit.

All the additional source for producing and animating the aliens
is contained in the assembler source files MENACE.S, PATHS.S and SHIPS.S.

By combining these source it's possible to assemble the complete thing 
into the compiled demo on this disk. Alternatively you can modify the 
combined source to produce something completely different.

Use something like Devpac 2 or Argasm to compile the source.

The files in the drawer DAVE JONES' LOCKER include:

MENACE - compiled demo
MENACE.S - demo source
SHIPS.S - craft source
PATHS.S - alien flight paths source

Please note ALIENS, FOREGROUNDS, MAP and PANEL also make part of the Menace
program. These can be found on previous Amiga Format disks.
