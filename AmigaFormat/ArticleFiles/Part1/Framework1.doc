	This source code, written for Devpac2, is the framework for
assembly programs on the amiga that wish to make full use of the copper,
blitter etc. without having to reset the machine after trying out a program.
It basically kills the operating system, allowing the program to run at full
speed. Memory however must be allocated properly, and only this memory used.
About 400K of free memory is avaliable with only an assembler running. 
This code will be used to demonstrate particular routines from 'Menace' as 
they are documented in future editions of Amiga Format.
	A full description of the source is in this months issue.
