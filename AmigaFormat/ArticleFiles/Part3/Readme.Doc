THE CONTENTS OF DAVE JONES' LOCKER

Everything in Dave Jones' Locker (drawer) goes with the feature on games
programming in the April issue (number 9) of Amiga Format.

This month Psygnosis programmer Dave Jones adds ship movement, overlaid
hardware sprites, joyystick read, mouse read and ship animtion to last
month's beautiful horizontal scroll. 

You can double click on the MOVESHIP program icon to see the result of
combining last month's scroll with this month's ship animation.

All the additional source for producing and animating the ship
is contained in two assembler source files called SHIPS.S and MOVESHIP.S

By combining these source files with last month's source files it's possible
to assemble the complete thing into the compiled demo on this disk.
Alternatively you can modify the combined source to produce something 
completely different.

USe something like Devpac 2 or Argasm to compile the source.

The files in the drawer DAVE JONES' LOCKER include:

MOVESHIP - compiled demo
SHIPS.S - craft source
MOVESHIP.S - animation routine etc

To successfully compile, you will need the following from last month:

foregrounds
map
panel
menace scroll.s
